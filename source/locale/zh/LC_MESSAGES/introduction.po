"Easy Patch 2 can help you create standard topology mesh in a patch, you "
"can freely draw the boundary of patch, the result consists by quad mesh "
"and pole with only N-Pole and E-Pole. This is not a fully automatic "
"retopology addon, this addon is suitable for those who want to control "
"edge flow. The number of edgeflow boundaries you can create is 3~6."

"For a good result, you should know the edge flow going. A simple way to "
"distinguish edge flow is separate it them by sharp corner. Every edge "
"flow for a correspond boundary, and the addon will calculate the "
"combination of edge flow. A edge flow is like a grid mesh, in the head "
"example below, the edge flow coming from the eye, cheek, chin, mouse, "
"nose.(It can be observed that the edge flow coming from the nose and "
"philtrum do not have a clear sharp corner to separate them, so I regard "
"them as one edge flow.) , so I draw 5 boundaries for every edge flow."
